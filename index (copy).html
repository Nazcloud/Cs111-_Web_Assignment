  <p> For this page I would just like to give an idea of how many different schools I've been to. For elementary school I went to Levan Scott Academy, for middle school I went to miami, for high school I went to Wayne High school. I am now at huntington university and as far as I know I'm planning on finishing my college career here but you never know what God has planned.</p>
