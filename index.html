  Hello world
  <h1> Intro</h1>

  <p>My name is <b>Nazareth</b> I am studying Graphic Design at <i> Huntington University</i> with a fine arts minor. I
    am currently a sophmore and run track and field here. It has been a great experience so far and I am looking forward
    to seeing where I go here. I've gather field experience in a lot of things such as my classes from last year and I
    am looking forward to learning more about the field.
    <br> to learn more about my classes click <a href="index (copy).html"> here </a>
<br>
    
    <br>I am also looking forward to learning more about the career path I want to take in the future. There are tons of
    things I can do with Graphic design but the quicker I get more specific with what I do the better I'll actually
    enjoy my job

    <br> it's really <strong> difficult</strong> to manage what I want to do verse what I can do but the progression is
    always worth it even if it takes me a little longer I know <em> God </em> has a plan for my life so I have nothing
    to worry about
  <p></p>

  <h2> My goal</h2>

  <P> Here is a list my goals for this school year</P>
  <li> Improve design skill set </li>
  <li> Become more knowledgable about things</li>
  <li> Become even closer to Christ</li>
  <li> Run faster times in races</li>
  <li> Have amazing relationships around campus</li>
